## Description
This is a Tap Room where a Boba Bar can track its tea storage!

It will at the minimum, have CREATE and READ functionality. And if am succesfully ambitious, will have UPDATE and DELETE functionality.

User stories:
- as a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available teas. For each tea, I want to see its
  - `name`
  - `brand`
  - `price`
  - `flavor`
- as a user, I want to submit a form to add a new tea to a list
- as a user, I want to be able to click on a tea to see its detail page
- as a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a tea urn (holds 32 pints)
- as a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it.
  - this should decrease the number of pints left by 1
  - pints should not go below 0
